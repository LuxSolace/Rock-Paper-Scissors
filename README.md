# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project was meant to be an assignment for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors), a simple rock paper scissors ui to play the game with instead of the console. 

It just so happens that you can find a lot of free-to-use graphical assets in the indie video game community, and that I like video games in general, hence the idea to turn the rock paper scissors game ui into something akin to a fighting game. 

It was quite the learning experience, and I might revisit the project again to add sounds for atmosphere, and other details, such as an ennemy sprite that is not a "evil double"...
